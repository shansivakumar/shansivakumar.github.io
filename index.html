									<Strong><h3>Student Advocacy</h3></Strong>
									<p>To be the VP of Academic Affairs means to be the voice between students and their academics. My goal as VP Academics would be to listen, inform and advocate on behalf of the Engineering Student Body. 
										It is important to be able to communicate the academic concerns affecting students based on their feedback to better enhance the quality of learning here at the University Of Guelph.

									</p>
									<p> Being apart of multiple events and clubs has allowed me 
										to understand and communicate the issues students are currently facing. As VP Academic I would like to bring these issues up and resolve them via curriculum changes and student feedback. 
										In order to reach all students, I will be creating a form that will allow students to submit their concerns that will be available on our website, weekly email and social media.
										To reach all disciplines, myself and the year reps will have regularly scheduled meetings in order to keep up to date with the student body.
